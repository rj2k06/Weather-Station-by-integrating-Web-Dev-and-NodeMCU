# IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring System Using NodeMCU

This project is an IoT-enabled environmental monitoring system powered by the NodeMCU Wi-Fi development board. The system is designed to gather real-time environmental data and make it accessible remotely via a web-based interface.

At the core of the system is the NodeMCU ESP8266 board, which collects data from multiple sensors including the DHT11 (for temperature and humidity) and a rain sensor. These sensors continuously monitor the surrounding environment and send their readings to the NodeMCU for processing.

The NodeMCU is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, allowing it to transmit the collected sensor data over the internet. The data is made available through a local IP address, which hosts a live web dashboard that can be accessed on any device within the same network.

To enhance usability, a basic front-end interface was developed using standard web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interface displays the sensor data in a clean and user-friendly format, improving both aesthetics and readability. The web page dynamically updates in real-time, providing instant insight into changing environmental conditions.
## Key features of this project include:

### Real-time temperature, humidity, and rainfall data monitoring

### Wireless data transmission using the NodeMCU ESP8266

### Local hosting of a dynamic web dashboard via IP address

### Custom front-end design to enhance readability and usability

### Scalability for additional sensors or cloud-based integration

This project demonstrates the practical application of IoT and web development in environmental monitoring, offering a cost-effective and accessible solution for remote data tracking and visualization.
